## üìå Project Overview

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting joints. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying RA is essential to identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study used public microarray datasets and integrated bioinformatics tools to:

- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RA patients
- Perform functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways
- Construct PPI networks and extract key hub genes
- Highlight potential biomarkers and gene functions relevant to RA pathogenesis

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. Identify key DEGs in RA patient datasets retrieved from GEO (GSE205962, GSE224842, GSE80785)
2. Perform enrichment analysis (GO and KEGG) to understand biological functions and pathways
3. Construct protein‚Äìprotein interaction (PPI) networks for DEGs
4. Detect hub genes that may serve as **potential biomarkers** for RA
